# danhigg-wk2-challenge

For the second weekly challenge I created a portfolio for prospective employers learn about me, review my body of work, and have access to links to contact me, if needed.

## Notes

Limitations: Although I included a resposive design for smaller screens, If I were to further develop this application I would implement accommodations for screens larger than 1200px in width.

A line of code was inserted by my course instructor to fix the About Me section dissapearing off the screen, due to the float property of the header navigation affecting the following section when resizing the application.

Avatar image asset is my own previously commissioned work.
